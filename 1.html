    <h3>history</h3>

    <p>
      When settlers sailed from Europe to North America, they carried cats on
      board (ships' cats) to protect the stores from mice[3]â€”for instance, the
      cats that came over on the Mayflower with the Pilgrims to hunt rats on the
      ship and in the colony.[4] Many of these cats landed in the New World,
      interbred, and developed special characteristics to help them cope with
      their new life and climate. Early in the 20th century, a selective
      breeding program was established to develop the best qualities of these
      cats.
