    <p>
      The American Shorthair is a medium-sized cat, but she is a very powerful
      one. She is heavily muscled and has heavy boning. Her rounded, thick
      appearance makes you realize that she will be heavy when you pick her up.
      The American Shorthair is a powerful cat. All components of this cat
      should be well developed. She has a broad chest, a muscular neck, strong
      jaws and a well-developed muzzle. Her legs are thick and strong. She looks
      like what she was originally meant to be, a cat to keep rodents out of the
      barn and the house. The coat of the American Shorthair is thick and dense.
      Her coat becomes much longer and thicker during the winter. The texture of
      her coat is relatively hard as it is meant as protection for her.

      The American Shorthair is a very pleasant companion cat. She is easy going
      and placid. The American is a loving cat and will attach herself to all
      members of the family. While the American loves to play, she doesn't need
      hourly attention. If she is in the mood to play, she will bring her parent
      a toy. The American also plays well by herself. She is a very good
      companion for single people.

      <strong> living With: </strong>
      <br />
      The American Shorthair is a thick, muscular cat and her nutrition must be
      carefully controlled. Despite the heavy boning and musculature of the cat,
      you want to make certain that she keeps a proper weight and does not get
      out of condition. The American will play when she wants to play. She will
      find a toy or create one out of anything she finds if a cat toy is not
      available. Interactive play may be necessary to keep her in good shape and
      make certain that she gets adequate exercise. Daily brushing is important,
      especially during the change of seasons when her coat is thickening or
      thinning. Even this Shorthair cat can get knots in her coat if she isn't
      brushed regularly. The American Shorthair tolerates being left alone. She
      is an affectionate cat, but also spends time just sleeping in the sun. The
      American is an easy cat to care for and makes a wonderful, quiet
      companion.
