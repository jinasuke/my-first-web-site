    <p>
      If you close your eyes and visualize the beautiful shorthaired cat that
      slept on your bed and comforted you when you were a child, you are very
      likely picturing a cat that closely resembles the American Shorthair. The
      perfect family cat, the American Shorthair is known for its intelligence,
      quiet disposition, beauty, and hardy build. Every part of its structure
      allows it to move with power, endurance, and agility. There is nothing
      about its appearance that is exaggerated. The general effect is that of a
      strongly built, well-balanced, symmetrical cat. The cat is surprisingly
      heavy. Even the female, which may be slightly smaller than the male, has a
      well-padded and muscled body. The breed usually achieves full growth at
      approximately three to four years old with the mature males weighing
      eleven to fifteen pounds and the mature females weighing eight to twelve
      pounds.
