      Although it is not an extremely athletic cat, the American Shorthair has a
      large, powerfully-built body. According to the breed standard of the Cat
      Fanciers' Association, the American Shorthair is a true breed of working
      cat.[3] They have round faces and short ears. According to the CFA,
      American Shorthairs are low-maintenance cats that are generally healthy,
      easy-going, affectionate with owners and social with strangers. Males are
      significantly larger than females, weighing eleven to fifteen pounds when
      fully grown. Mature females weigh six to twelve pounds when they achieve
      full growth at three to four years of age.[3] With a quality diet and
      plenty of attention, love, and care, they can live 15 years or longer,
      requiring annual vaccinations and veterinary checkups. These cats have
      solidly built, powerful, and muscular bodies with well-developed
      shoulders, chests, and hindquarters.[7] The American Shorthair is
      recognized in more than eighty different colors and patterns ranging from
      the brown-patched tabby to the blue-eyed white, the shaded silvers, smokes
      and cameos to the calico van, and many colors in between.[8] Some even
      come in deep tones of black, brown, or other blends and combinations.
      Generally, only cats showing evidence of crossbreeding resulting in the
      colors chocolate, sable, lavender, lilac, or the point-restricted pattern
      of the Siamese family are disqualified from being shown.[3]
